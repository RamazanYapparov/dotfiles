# Azure Account and Login
The Azure Account extension provides a single Azure login and subscription filtering experience for all other Azure extensions.

## Commands


| Command |  |
| --- |---|
| `Azure: Login`  | Login to your Azure subscription.
| `Azure: Logout` | Log out of your Azure subscription.
| `Azure: Select Subscription` | Pick the set of subscriptions you want to work with. Extensions should respect this list and only show resources within the filtered subscriptions.
| `Azure: Create an Account`  | If you don't have an Azure Account, you can [sign up](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?utm_source=campaign&utm_campaign=vscode-azure-account&mktingSource=vscode-azure-account) for one today and receive $200 in free credits.
